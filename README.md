# lilly-technical-challenge
A repository containing the Eli Lilly student developer technical challenge.


## Objectives
- Fetch data from the backend server from the frontend, and display it in a user-friendly way.
- A data engineer had some issues migrating data, leaving some gaps in our database. How can you ensure that the frontend handles missing/invalid data returned from the APIs without crashing?
- You can send data to the backend via API(s), however it is not particularly user-friendly. How will you create a user-friendly solution that allows users to input data on the site and send it to the backend?
- The frontend site's design leaves a lot to be desired. Can you make any improvement to the overall design and user experience? (this one is open-ended; feel free to be creative here!)
- You are provided a documentation template and are encouraged to fill this out as you work through this challenge. This will help when it comes time to present your work.

### Optional Objectives
*These objectives can be completed if you have time or would like to be challenged.*
  
- The raw data returned from the backend is a little hard to digest. Can you create a backend function for averaging prices for a particular medicine?
